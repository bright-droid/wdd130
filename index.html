            <p>Hello there, My name is Bright, Bright Ndubuisi. It is nice to meet you. I am 20 years old and currently enrolled in BYU-Idaho, studying Web and Computer programming. I look forward to learning new things in this course. I like to draw, paint and even animate(even though I am still in a beginner phase with that one :) Something else I enjoy is Japanese animations. These have very unique and often captivating stories and plot that just tend to pull you in, even allowing you to fall inlove with the characters. I love to listen to slow tunes while doing an activity, they help me calm down and give me this warm, homey feeling. I like to make new people and travel to new places also.

            <p>Nigeria is the country where I was born, making it my home 
                country. I have spent all my life living in NIgeria with my
                family. Nigeria is the also known as the giant of Africa, 
                being home to different and a vast number of tribes, cultures
                and even cuisines. One of the very popular nigerian dishes is
                "Jollof rice", being even popular among foreigners.
